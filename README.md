# KitsuneKomix

## Introduction

Welcome fellow comic book fans, if you're anything like me and you've built up a
backlog of comics and manga, i'm looking at you humble bundle, and as you work
thorugh reading them you've looked for an easy solution to serve up your files
to your phone and tablet without going through the process of loading up comic
files manually. This project is being built up to be the solution

### Wait haven't you heard of Komga or Kavita?

Yes I have and i've switched between using them for the passed couple of years
since i've started self hosting some of my own apps or services, both are good
but each is missing some stuff that dosen't complete my user experience, both
get the basic job done but i've found that both lack metadata support, theres
plenty of comic metadata databases/api out there and with simple to use softwear
like comicTagger you can store details about your comics in the file's metadata
like characters, story arc, details that can entice you to jump in, but neither
really takes advantage of this,
